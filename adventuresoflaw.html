<g>How did this experience influence your thoughts about your future career possibilities?  </g> 
<br /><br />This experience taught me much about Law and the legal field. For instance, did you know that Judges can hide their documents without getting a permit for it? 
<br /><br />
<h>The Experience</h>
<br /><br />
<br /><br />Most clients don’t want to pay, so working as a lawyer means you’ll have to call up some poor saps at their lowest point and yell at them until they fork over the cash. It’s brutal work, seemingly,  but if there’s any motivation to pursue this career it’s that sweet, sweet paycheque. As I walked down the hallowed halls of Nicole B Erickson Attorney at Law, I noted lawyers working for as much as a lot of money. At top dollar, I’d say it’s worth the mark on your soul to be a lawyer. For a million bucks an hour, I could buy this shoddy school, and I think it’s worth whatever poor granny’s heart disease gets advanced a few stages for that kind of cash. 
<br /><br />
<br /><br />There is reportedly, however, a risk with this kind of profession. Less fortunate lawyering types may find themselves in a difficult situation at times. 
<br /><br />
<h>The Cartel Needs Legal Help Too: A Short Story</h>
<br />
<br /><br />Once upon a time, there was this woman in her forties that got hired to defend a man who wasn’t in the cartel. He’d never been in the cartel, and anyone who claimed this to be true was probably wrong, wherever they were. 
<br /><br />
<br /><br />The IRS, however, suspected this poor innocent man of being a cartel member. He found himself in a difficult situation that day, men in suits knocking on his door demanding the cash, and so he turned to the only place he thought could provide help, Nicole B Erickson Attorney at Law LLC. 
<br /><br />
<br /><br />Well, Nicole B Erickson Attorney at Law LLC came to his defense at once. In a court of  law, Nicole B Erickson Attorney at Law LLC made sure nobody would ever accuse this man of being a cartel member ever again.
<br /><br />
<br /><br />“He’s not a cartel member,” Nicole B Erickson Attorney at Law LLC said, and everyone nodded and agreed. This was fortunate. However, the situation itself provides an example of the risk lawyering types face. What if Nicole B Erickson Attorney at Law LLC had said something different, and everyone hadn’t nodded or agreed? What fate would have befallen Nicole B Erickson Attorney at Law LLC’s family, Nicole B Erickson Attorney at Law LLC’s children?
<br /><br />
<br /><br />Nicole B Erickson Attorney at Law LLC reports additionally that Nicole B Erickson Attorney at Law LLC has received threats at times, reportedly having to secure defense weaponry before traipsing down to the office one day. What kind of profession forces you to do that? The kind that pays good. There is no reward without risk.
 <br /><br /><g><b>What action did/will you take to learn more or prepare for this future career possibility?</b> No action?  It’s not a CRLE.</g>
<br /><br />I’ll for sure brush up on my self defense skills, maybe take a tai chi class. If I delve into this mysterious “legal field”, I’ll want to improve my prose and stop writing pointless articles, and maybe even learn some “grammar”. 
<br /><br />
<br /><br />“ I would like to continue and do some law in the future .”
